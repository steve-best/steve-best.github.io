(These were the days when we were still using Windows 2000 at work, and my home PC was still running Windows 98.) Toward the end of our conversation, he proceeded to tell me about...</p>

Apple's site states watchOS 9 will be compatible with Apple Watch Series 4, Apple Watch Series 5, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 6, and Apple Watch Series 7. However, notably absent from this list is the Apple Watch Series 3.</p>

<p class="title">Paper vs reMarkable</p>
<p class="brief">As of late, ads for the reMarkable 2 have been showing up in my Instagram feed. The reMarkable 2 is the second generation of the reMarkable, a thin, e-ink tablet that is supposed to come very close to mimicking the feel of writing on paper, and upon first glance, this tablet appears to be a remarkable product, worthy of its name.</p>

<p class="title">Browser Choice in iOS</p>

<p class="brief">As of January 4, 2022 all BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry 7.1 or earlier, BlackBerry 10, and BlackBerry Playbook OS (i.e., all non-Android BlackBerry devices) will “no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality”.

<p class="title">Microsoft Edge Stable for Linux</p>
<p class="brief">Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) is my main browser on my Raspberry PiMac, since it is stable, private, secure, and fast. I also appreciate Mozilla's developer tools and the fact that Firefox represents an option other than the Blink rendering engine, which all browsers based on Chromium use. However, Firefox ESR does not support video or proprietary codecs very well on this machine. As such, I decided to give the beta version of Microsoft Edge for Linux a try.</p>

<p class="title">A Few Fun Facts About the NES</p>
<p class="brief">As a second grader at Piney Grove Elementary School in 1987, I became keenly aware of the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES for short.

<p class="brief">My beautiful wife knows that I like Casio's G-Shock watches, and I wore the same G-Shock as my daily watch for about five years prior to getting my Apple Watch in 2018. One of the gifts my wife bought for me for my birthday this year was a watch band that gives the Apple Watch that “G-Shock” look. I like it alot.</p>

<p class="title">New iPhones</p>
<p class="brief">Apple held an event on September 14, during which they announced the new line up of iPhones, a new Apple Watch, and two new iPads. I like these events, and being a tech enthusiast, I always watch. However, most years I come away a little disappointed with what was announced, and frankly, this year was no exception.</p>

<p class="title">Raspberry PiMac</p>
<p class="brief">In 2008 my wife and I purchased our first (and only) computer made by Apple — an iMac. It was a significant investment at the time, our goal being to get at least six years of use out of it. It has served us well as our family desktop, and I am happy to report that even thirteen years later, our iMac is still trucking along.</p>

<p class="title">What I Learned on Summer Vacation</p>
<p class="brief">I was fortunate enough this summer to be able to take three vacations. In late June, my family and I spent a week at the beach. My wife and I flew to Jamaica to celebrate our twentieth anniversary in July, and our family visited Mt. Gretna, Pennsylvania during the first week of August. Now that the vacations are over, it feels like summer is coming to a close. My wife, who is a teacher, is now setting up her classroom for the upcoming school year. We have begun back-to-school shopping, and my oldest son is preparing to go to college on Saturday. As I think back on the events of the summer, here are some of my observations (in no particular order).</p>

<p class="title">On Making Do</p>
<p class="brief">I’ve always been one to jump at the chance to buy new tech anytime I can. So when our Roku Streaming Stick Plus started making weird cracking and popping sounds last week, my first thought was to immediately replace it with a Chromecast with Google TV. I had been wanting one ever since they were announced last fall, but since every TV in our house has a way to stream content (either because it is a Roku TV or a Roku box or stick) I could not really justify it. It would also be a good excuse to try out Stadia.</p>

<p class="brief">My wife and I were out and about last week, and we stopped by 2nd & Charles, where I happened upon a copy of Tetris for the Nintendo Game Boy, which just happened to be in very good condition. Seeing as how I still have my original Game Boy Pocket but not Tetris, I jumped at the chance to buy it. (Tetris was included with most original Game Boy systems, but to my knowledge, it did not come included with the Game Boy Pocket.)</p>

<p class="title">Thoughts on Browser Updates</p>
<p class="brief">I came across an interesting article over on Arstechnica earlier this week, and it got me thinking about the way that Apple updates Safari on iOS. Because Safari is a part of the OS and not separated from the OS itself, Apple updates Safari through updates to iOS itself. It seems to me...</p>

<p class="title">A Thought Experiment</p>
<p class="brief">I saw an intriguing article on Inc.’s website a while back that revealed Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, does not use a laptop, but instead uses only his iPhone as his singular computing device. This notion has been pinging around in my brain for some time, as there is something refreshing about having only one device.</p>

<p class="title">I Keep Coming Back to Ubuntu</p>
<p class="brief">There's this famous line, I think from Godfather III, where Michael Corleone says, “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in”. I feel like that about Ubuntu. For one reason or another, every time a new version of Fedora is released I feel compelled to switch to it, and without fail, I end up going back to Ubuntu.</p>

<p class="title">Planned Obsolescence & My Samsung Chromebook</p>
<p class="brief">I “inherited” an 11” Samsung Chromebook from my parents when my mom decided to buy an iPad. It has an ARM processor and 2GB of RAM. It’s really light and thin. Plus, the battery is still good. Even though it’s a little underpowered by today’s standards, it’s definitely not a bad little machine, especially for doing stuff like email, Google Docs and Sheets, surfing the web, listening to music, and watching a YouTube video here or there. There’s just one little problem with this Chromebook. It’s sitting in a drawer in a “powerwashed” state because Google stopped updating it in July of 2018.</p>

<p class="title">A Little Web 1.0 Nostalgia</p>
<p class="brief">I recently read an interesting piece by Manuel Moreale that made me briefly nostalgic about my first experiences with the web. I was in college, and it was during the Web 1.0 “dot com” days. The web was new and exciting. Clicking on the Netscape Navigator icon meant that there would soon be a world of information at your fingertips. It was amazing that we rarely had to step foot in the huge school library. Ebsco Host and NCLive were used for lots of research.</p>

<p class="title">What's on my iPhone?</p>
<p class="brief">Important notes about all sorts of things. The Bible. Email. Text messages. Daily reminders. Research. Books. Important photos. Work stuff. Drafts of blog posts. HTML files for this site. Music. Podcasts. Games. Entertainment. In short — everything. I consider my iPhone 11 to be by far my most used “computer”.</p>

<p class="title">The Year of the Linux Desktop is Finally Here</p>
<p class="brief">I came across an interesting article this morning over on Ars Technica that says Chrome OS now has the second largest desktop OS market share at 10.8%, behind Windows (at 80.5%). From the article...</p>

<p class="title">Pop!_OS First Impressions</p>
<p class="brief">When Linux computer maker System76 released their own distro, Pop!_OS, I did not really pay it too much attention. I was happily dual booting Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Windows 10 on my laptop at the time, and since then, I ditched Windows and hopped between Ubuntu, elementary OS and Fedora as the sole OS on my laptop, always returning to Ubuntu since it was the only distro that would properly support two-finger scrolling on my particular hardware. (elementary OS used to support two-finger scrolling just fine, but their 5.1 release broke that functionality.) Overall, I’ve been happy with Ubuntu. However, I recently came across a really good review of a System76 laptop, and being impressed by Pop!_OS, I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p class="title">Apple Music + Google Nest = :-)</p>
<p class="brief">Back when I originally bought into Google’s ecosystem of smart speakers and displays, I was a Spotify premium subscriber, and I had this service enabled as the default. Even as an iPhone user, I originally chose Google’s smart speakers and displays over those of Amazon and Apple because of how much “smarter” the Google Assistant was than Alexa or Siri and how immersed I already was in Google’s ecosystem for email, calendars, and reminders. Other than a Prime subscription, I had nothing in Amazon except a few movie and Kindle purchases, and Apple’s HomePod was extremely overpriced.</p>

<p class="title">Thoughts on the New iPhones and the HomePod Mini</p>
<p class="brief">Fall inevitably means new Apple products. In mid-September they announced a new watch and iPads, and they just announced new iPhones and a HomePod mini. Given that I have not yet used any of these products, the thoughts below are just some first impressions based on what was announced and my own bias.</p>

<p class="title">Sega Genesis Mini</p>
<p class="brief">Icompletely missed the Sega Genesis. I was in middle school around the time that Sega’s follow up to the Master System was gaining in popularity. I saw the “Genesis does what Nintendon’t” ads on TV, and I played the Genesis from time to time while hanging out with friends. However, I never asked my parents for the Genesis. I was a bit of a Nintendo fanboy...</p>

<p class="title">The Computer on My Wrist</p>
<p class="brief">Since receiving it as a birthday gift in September 2018, I can recall precisely two occasions when I have not worn my Apple Watch. The first occasion was for an important face to face business meeting, and I opted for a dressier watch. The second was this past Sunday. I have a few fairly nice watches that have been collecting dust on my nightstand, and on a whim, I decided to wear one of those watches to an afternoon family gathering.</p>

<p class="title">Learning From My Mistakes</p>
<p class="brief">Hi, I’m Steve, and I used to have a little slice of the web called The Art Directed Journal. My site was essentially a bunch of Github Pages that I had cobbled together as an excuse to practice HTML, CSS and improve my writing skills. It was essentially a fancy blog where each post had its own, unique style. I say that I used to have this site because due to a two-factor authentication snafu that was entirely my fault, I am essentially locked out of my Github account forever.</p>
